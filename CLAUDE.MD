## Project Goals

Build a self-evolving AI agent that can autonomously improve its own code and capabilities over time. The agent stores its code as 'skills' in a src/skills directory. This directory can be thought of as the skill-part of the brain of the agent that is always requested at runtime of the agent to solve input tasks.
